This source code was developed by referring to the github repository at the link below.

  -> https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf-bootstrap (with minimal example)

This is just taking the code from the `minimal example` in the link above and matching the filename to the example I was already using to make it easier for me to understand. (There are many examples in that link.)

Also, you can use a `makefile` to build the build environment, but I thought it might be a bit confusing to use a `makefile` without a clear understanding of how to build it, so I used a `shell script`.
